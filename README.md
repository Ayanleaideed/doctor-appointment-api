# Doctor Appointment Management System API

This API is a sample implementation for the ADRD project, showcasing how a multi-agent system can streamline doctor appointment management. It focuses on core functionalities like checking doctor availability, booking appointments, and handling conflicts with alternative suggestions.

This system is designed to be a foundational component for a more comprehensive multi-agent ecosystem capable of managing healthcare-related interactions.

---

## üöÄ Core Functionalities
- **Check Doctor Avasilability**: Retrieve available time slots for doctors by day or week.
- **Book Appointments**: Schedule appointments while avoiding conflicts.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Automatically adjusts availability based on booked slots.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Provides alternative time suggestions if a requested slot is unavailable.

  "request_type": "consultation",
  "appointment_datetime": "11/29/2024 at 09:00 AM",
  "status": "success"
}
```

**If Conflict Exists:**
```json
{

## Purpose in the ADRD Project

This system represents a sample module for a larger multi-agent system aimed at managing interactions in healthcare settings, particularly for Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementia (ADRD). The ultimate goal is to integrate this API with intelligent agents that handle complex workflows like:
- Coordinating between patients, doctors, and caregivers.
- Automating appointment scheduling and reminders.
- Providing personalized healthcare assistance based on patient needs.

This implementation demonstrates how an appointment system can be both practical on its own and a stepping stone to broader, more intelligent applications.
